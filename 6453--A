 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation to the training
 and use of artificial intelligence frontier model

The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assem-
 bly, do enact as follows:

Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 2 the "Responsible AI safety and education act" or "RAISE act".
 3 ยง 2. The general business law is amended by adding a new article 44-B
 4 to read as follows:

ARTICLE 44-B
 RESPONSIBLE AI SAFETY AND EDUCATION (RAISE) ACT
 Section 1420. Definitions.
 1421. Transparency requirements regarding frontier model train-
 ing and use.
 1422. Violations.
 1423. Duties and obligations.
 1424. Preemption.
 1425. Preemption.

 ยง 1420. Definitions. As used in this article, the following terms
 shall have the following meanings:
 1. "Appropriate redactions" means redactions to a safety and security
 protocol or audit report that are reasonably necessary to protect any of the following:

(a) protect public safety to the extent the developer can reasonably
 predict such risks;
(b) protect trade secrets; or
(c) prevent the release of confidential information as required by
state or federal law;
(d) protect employee or customer privacy; or
(e) prevent the release of information otherwise controlled by state
or federal law.

2. "Artificial intelligence" means a machine-based system that can,
for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommen-
dations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments, and that
uses machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual envi-
ronments, abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an
automated manner, and use model inference to formulate options for
information or action.

3. "Artificial intelligence model" means an information system or
component of an information system that implements artificial intelli-
gence technology and uses computational, statistical, or machine-learn-
ing techniques to produce outputs from a given set of inputs.

4. "Compute cost" means the cost incurred to pay for compute used in
the final training run of a model when calculated using the average
published market prices of cloud compute in the United States at the
start of training such model as reasonably assessed by the person doing
the training.

5. "Deploy" means to use a frontier model or to make a frontier model
foreseeably available to one or more third parties for use, modifica-
tion, copying, or a combination thereof with other software, except for
training or developing the frontier model, evaluating the frontier model
or other frontier models, or complying with federal or state laws.

6. "Frontier model" means either of the following:
 (a) an artificial intelligence model trained using greater than 10ยบ26
 computational operations (e.g., integer or floating-point operations),
 the compute cost of which exceeds one hundred million dollars; or
 (b) an artificial intelligence model produced by applying knowledge
 distillation to a frontier model as defined in paragraph (a) of this
 subdivision, provided that the compute cost for such model produced by
 applying knowledge distillation exceeds five million dollars.

7. "Critical harm" means the death or serious injury of one hundred or
more people or at least one billion dollars of damages to rights in
money or property caused or materially enabled by a large developer's
use, storage, or release of a frontier model, through either of the
following:
(a) The creation or use of a chemical, biological, radiological, or
nuclear weapon; or
(b) An artificial intelligence model engaging in conduct that does
both of the following:
(i) Acts with no meaningful human intervention; and
(ii) Would, if committed by a human, constitute a crime specified in
the penal law that requires intent, recklessness, or gross negligence,
or the solicitation or aiding and abetting of such a crime.
A harm inflicted by an intervening human actor shall not be deemed to
result from a developer's activities unless such activities were a
substantial factor in bringing about the harm, the intervening human
actor's conduct was reasonably foreseeable as a probable consequence of
the developer's activities, and could have been reasonably prevented or
mitigated through alternative design, or security measures, or safety
protocols.

8. "Knowledge distillation" means any supervised learning technique
that uses a larger artificial intelligence model or the output of a
larger artificial intelligence model to train a smaller artificial
intelligence model with similar or equivalent capabilities as the larger
artificial intelligence model.

9. "Large developer" means a person that has trained at least one
frontier model and has spent over one hundred million dollars in compute
costs in aggregate in training frontier models. Accredited colleges and
universities shall not be considered large developers under this article
to the extent that such colleges and universities are engaging in
academic research. If a person subsequently transfers full intellectual
property rights of the frontier model to another person (including the
right to resell the model) and retains none of those rights for them-
self, then the receiving person shall be considered the large developer
and shall be subject to the responsibilities and requirements of this
article after such transfer.

10. "Model weight" means a numerical parameter in an artificial intel-
ligence model that is adjusted through training and that helps determine
how inputs are transformed into outputs.

11. "Person" means an individual, proprietorship, firm, partnership,
joint venture, syndicate, business trust, company, corporation, limited
liability company, association, committee, or any other nongovernmental
organization or group of persons acting in concert.

12. "Safety and security protocol" means documented technical and
organizational protocols that:

(a) Describe reasonable protections and procedures that, if success-
fully implemented would appropriately reduce the risk of critical harm;

(b) Describe reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
cybersecurity protections for frontier models within the large develop-
er's control that, if successfully implemented, appropriately reduce the
risk of unauthorized access to, or misuse of, the frontier models lead-
ing to critical harm, including by sophisticated actors;

(c) Describe in detail the testing procedure to evaluate if the fron-
tier model poses an unreasonable risk of critical harm and whether the
frontier model could be misused, be modified, be executed with increased
computational resources, evade the control of its large developer or
user, be combined with other software or be used to create another fron-
tier model in a manner that would increase the risk of critical harm;

(d) Enable the large developer or third party to comply with the
requirements of this article; and

(e) Designate senior personnel to be responsible for ensuring compli-
ance.

 13. "Safety incident" means an incident of the following kinds that
 occurs in such a way that it provides demonstrable evidence of an
 increased risk of critical harm:
 
(a) A frontier model autonomously engaging in behavior other than at
 the request of a user;

(b) Theft, misappropriation, malicious use, inadvertent release, unau-
 thorized access, or escape of the model weights of a frontier model;

(c) The critical failure of any technical or administrative controls,
 including controls limiting the ability to modify a frontier model; or
 (d) Unauthorized use of a frontier model.

14. "Trade secret" means any form and type of financial, business,
scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information, including a
pattern, plan, compilation, program device, formula, design, prototype,
method, technique, process, procedure, program, or code, whether tangi-
ble or intangible, and whether or how stored, compiled, or memorialized
physically, electronically, graphically, photographically or in writing,
that:

(a) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not
being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper
means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclo-
sure or use; and

(b) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circum-
stances to maintain its secrecy.

ยง 1421. Transparency requirements regarding frontier model training
and use. 1. Before deploying a frontier model, the large developer of
such frontier model shall do all of the following:

(a) Implement a written safety and security protocol;

(b) Retain an unredacted copy of the safety and security protocol,
including records and dates of any updates or revisions. Such unredacted
copy of the safety and security protocol, including records and dates of
any updates or revisions, shall be retained for as long as a frontier
model is deployed plus five years;

(c) (i) Conspicuously publish a copy of the safety and security proto-
col with appropriate redactions and transmit a copy of such redacted
safety and security protocol to the attorney general and division of
homeland security and emergency services;

(ii) Grant the attorney general and division of homeland security and
emergency services or the attorney general access to the safety and
security protocol, with redactions only to the extent required by feder-
al law, upon request;

(d) Record, as and when reasonably possible, and retain for as long as
the frontier model is deployed plus five years information on the
specific tests and test results used in any assessment of the frontier
model required by this section or the developer's safety and security
protocol that provides sufficient detail for third parties to replicate
the testing procedure; and

(e) Implement appropriate safeguards to prevent unreasonable risk of
critical harm.

2. A large developer shall not deploy a frontier model if doing so
would create an unreasonable risk of critical harm.

3. A large developer shall conduct an annual review of any safety and
security protocol required by this section to account for any changes
to the capabilities of their frontier models and industry best practices
and, if necessary, make modifications to such safety and security proto-
col. If any material modifications are made, the large developer shall
publish the safety and security protocol in the same manner as required
pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section.

4. A large developer shall disclose each safety incident affecting the
frontier model to the attorney general and division of homeland security
and emergency services within seventy-two hours of the large developer
learning of the safety incident or within seventy-two hours of the large
developer learning facts sufficient to establish a reasonable belief
that a safety incident has occurred. Such disclosure shall include: 

(a) the date of the safety incident; 
(b) the reasons the incident qualifies
as a safety incident as defined in subdivision thirteen of section four-
teen hundred twenty of this article; and 
(c) a short and plain statement
describing the safety incident.

5. A large developer shall not knowingly make false or materially
misleading statements or omissions in or regarding documents produced
pursuant to this section.

ยง 1422. Violations. 1. The attorney general may bring a civil action
for a violation of this article and to recover all of the following,
determined based on severity of the violation:

(a) For a violation of section fourteen hundred twenty-one of this
article, a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding ten million dollars
for a first violation and in an amount not exceeding thirty million
dollars for any subsequent violation.

(b) For a violation of section fourteen hundred twenty-one of this
article, injunctive or declaratory relief.

2. Nothing in this article shall be construed to establish a private
right of action associated with violations of this article.

3. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prevent a large
developer from asserting that another person, entity, or factor may be
responsible for any alleged harm, injury, or damage resulting from a
critical harm or a violation of this article.

4. This section does not limit the application of other laws.

ยง 1423. Duties and obligations. The duties and obligations imposed by
this article are cumulative with any other duties or obligations imposed
under other law and shall not be construed to relieve any party from any
duties or obligations imposed under other law and do not limit any
rights or remedies under existing law.

ยง 1424. Scope. This article shall only apply to frontier models that
are developed, deployed, or operating in whole or in part in New York
state.

ยง 1425. Severability. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision,
section or part of this article shall be adjudged by any court of compe-
tent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair,
or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in its opera-
tion to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, or part
thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment
shall have been made.

ยง 3. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
have become a law.
