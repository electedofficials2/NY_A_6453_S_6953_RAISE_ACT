to more easily understand what has changed in a proposed piece of legislation. 

Also, using distributed version control systems enable asynchronous public comments are targeted fragments of proposed legislation.
Allowing logged in users to make comments similar to a town hall commentary.

Also, AI models may be used to generate comments on the proposed legislation.

of the models.
